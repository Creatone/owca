TODO
====

- miwanowski: more negative scenarios tests for config module. They should be added to test
  behaviour in edge cases (I would expect to see more tests similar to
  test_is_exception_raised_for_missing_filenameimport()
- miwanowski: tests for MesosNode.get_tasks()
- ppalucki: full description of how to use config.py as dependecy injection to construct
  own classes including register
